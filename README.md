# Introduction
***  
Our application will pair a list of upcoming live events at a venue with the forecasted UV rating and safe exposure time to
inform the user if the length of safe UV exposure time will cover the time they will be outside at the event.

# Requirements  
***
As a user, I will want to choose a venue for a live event so that I can view the UV forecast for the venue's upcoming events
and know how long I can safely spend in the sun without damaging my skin.

# Data Sources
***  
Our data sources include:  
-https://www.openuv.io/forecast  
-https://www.songkick.com/developer  
-https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/#search-events-v2  
  
Note that we will only use one of the last two, based on if we are granted permission to access one or the other.
