# Introduction
***  
Our application will pair a list of upcoming live events at a venue with the sunset time to
inform the user if they need to wear glasses when they are outside at the event.

# Requirements  
***
As a user, I will want to choose a venue for a live event so that I can view the sunset time for the venue's upcoming events
and know whether I need to bring my sunglasses.
